# BlazorGames

This project is a Blazor WebAssembly project where we design, model, implement, and play common board and card games.

You can see the deployed site here: [https://blazorgames.net/](https://blazorgames.net/)

This project is used in many blog posts on my site, including:

* [Minesweeper in Blazor WebAssembly Part 1: C# Implementation](https://exceptionnotfound.net/minesweeper-in-blazor-webassembly-part-1-csharp-implementation/)
* Minesweeper in Blazor WebAssembly Part 2: The Blazor Component

More to come!

Pull requests are welcome on this project.

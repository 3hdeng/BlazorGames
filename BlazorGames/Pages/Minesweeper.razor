<h2>How To Make Minesweeper in Blazor WebAssembly</h2>

<p>
    Minesweeper is considerably more complex than either the <a href="TicTacToe.razor">Tic Tac Toe</a>
    or <a href="ConnectFour.razor">ConnectFour</a> examples.
</p>

<h3>The Sample Project</h3>

<p>
    The sample project for this code is <a href="https://github.com/exceptionnotfound/BlazorGames">over on GitHub</a>.
    This tutorials assumes you already have a created Blazor WebAssembly and ASP.NET Core 3.1 or greater application.
</p>

<h3>Modeling the Game</h3>

<p>
    In order to model a game of Minesweeper, we must break it down into components that we can use. Let's take a look at a
    game of Minesweeper in progress:
</p>

<img src="../images/minesweeper/minesweeper-example.png" />

<p>
    Our modeling starts with the individual little "panels" on a game of Minesweeper. 
    Each panel can be either unrevealed (the starting state) or revealed, and once revealed, 
    each panel has either a mine, a number that represents the count of adjacent mines, 
    or a blank space. Further, an unrevealed panel can be "flagged" so that the user cannot 
    accidentally click on it; this is done to mark where the mines likely are.
</p>

<p>
    Let's create a C# class that has all of these attributes:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class Panel
{
    public int ID { get; set; }

    //Horizontal position
    public int X { get; set; }

    //Vertical position
    public int Y { get; set; }

    public bool IsMine { get; set; }

    public int AdjacentMines { get; set; }

    public bool IsRevealed { get; set; }

    public bool IsFlagged { get; set; }

    public Panel(int id, int x, int y)
    {
        ID = id;
        X = x;
        Y = y;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Each panel has two possible actions that can be performed against it: 
    they can be revealed (when clicked), or flagged (when right-clicked).
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class Panel
{
    //... Properties

    public void Flag()
    {
        if(!IsRevealed)
        {
            IsFlagged = !IsFlagged;
        }
    }

    public void Reveal()
    {
        IsRevealed = true;
        IsFlagged = false; //Revealed panels cannot be flagged
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    As far as the panels are concerned, this is the extent of their 
    functionality. The real work comes next, as we begin to design the game board itself.
</p>

<h3>The Game Board</h3>

<p>
    A game of minesweeper takes place on a board of X width and Y height, where 
    those numbers are defined by the user. Each board has Z mines hidden in its panels. 
    For every panel that is not a mine, a number is placed showing the count of mines 
    adjacent to that panel. We therefore need our GameBoard class to keep track of its 
    own dimensions, mine count, and collection of panels.
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    public int Width { get; set; } = 16;
    public int Height { get; set; } = 16;
    public int MineCount { get; set; } = 40;
    public List&lt;Panel&gt; Panels { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    We will be greatly expanding this class as we develop our game.
</p>

<h4>The Game Status</h4>

<p>
    Because the appearance of the Minesweeper board is determined by 
    the state of the game, we can use an enumeration to track said state.
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public enum GameStatus
{
    AwaitingFirstMove,
    InProgress,
    Failed,
    Completed
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    We must also allow the board to track the game state:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other properties

    public GameStatus Status { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Now let's build out the functionality of this board, starting with this question: how do "begin"
    a game of Minesweeper?
</p>

<h3>Initializing the Game</h3>

<p>
    Every game of Minesweeper begins in the same state, with all panels hidden. 
    Let's create a method to initialize a game, including creating the collection of panels. 
    Given the height, width, and mine count as parameters, here's what our initialization 
    method would look like:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Properties

    public void Initialize(int width, int height, int mines)
    {
        Width = width;
        Height = height;
        MineCount = mines;
        Panels = new List&lt;Panel&gt;();

        int id = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= height; i++)
        {
            for (int j = 1; j &lt;= width; j++)
            {
                Panels.Add(new Panel(id, j, i));
                id++;
            }
        }

        Status = GameStatus.AwaitingFirstMove;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    You might be wondering: why didn't we place the mines and calculate the 
    adjacent numbers? That's because of a trick in most implementations of 
    Minesweeper: they don't calculate where the mines are placed until after 
    the user makes the first move. This is so that the user doesn't click on 
    a mine on the first move, because that's no fun.
</p>

<p>
    For later usage, let's also implement a Reset method, which will reset 
    the board to a new game using the same width, height, and mine count:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other Properties and Methods

    public void Reset()
    {
        Initialize(Width, Height, MineCount);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Now we can work on the next major step of this implementation: the first move.
</p>

<h3>The First Move and Getting Neighbors</h3>

<p>
    We now need a method which represents the user's first move, and therefore 
    determines where the mines go and calculates the adjacent mines 
    numbers. That algorithm looks something like this:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        When the user makes the first move, take that panel and a certain number 
        of neighbor panels, and mark them as unavailable for mines.
    </li>
    <li>
        For every other panel, place the mines randomly.
    </li>
    <li>
        For every panel which is not a mine (including the panels from Step 1), 
        calculate the adjacent mines.
    </li>
    <li>
        Mark the game as started.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    The trickiest part of this algorithm is calculating the neighbors of a given panel. 
    Remember that the neighbors of any given panel are the first panel above, below, 
    to the left, to the right, and on each diagonal.
</p>

<img src="../images/minesweeper/minesweeper-neighbors.png" />

<p>
    For our implementation, we have an entire method to do this:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other Properties and Methods

    public List&lt;Panel&gt; GetNeighbors(int x, int y)
    {
        var nearbyPanels = Panels.Where(panel =&gt; panel.X &gt;= (x - 1)
        && panel.X &lt;= (x + 1)
        && panel.Y &gt;= (y - 1)
        && panel.Y &gt;= (y + 1));

        var currentPanel = Panels.Where(panel =&gt; panel.X == x && panel.Y == y);

        return nearbyPanels.Except(currentPanel).ToList();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    Using our "first move" algorithm, the new GetNeighbors() method, 
    and some fancy LINQ, we end up with this method to implement the first move:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other Properties and Methods
    
    public void FirstMove(int x, int y)
    {
        Random rand = new Random();

        //For any board, take the user's first revealed panel 
        // and any neighbors of that panel, and mark them 
        // as unavailable for mine placement.
        var neighbors = GetNeighbors(x, y); //Get all neighbors
        
        //Add the clicked panel to the "unavailable for mines" group.
        neighbors.Add(Panels.First(z => z.X == x && z.Y == y));

        //Select all panels from set which are available for mine placement.
        //Order them randomly.
        var mineList = Panels.Except(neighbors)
                             .OrderBy(user => rand.Next());
                             
        //Select the first Z random panels.
        var mineSlots = mineList.Take(MineCount)
                                .ToList()
                                .Select(z => new { z.X, z.Y });

        //Place the mines in the randomly selected panels.
        foreach (var mineCoord in mineSlots)
        {
            Panels.Single(panel => panel.X == mineCoord.X 
                                   && panel.Y == mineCoord.Y)
                  .IsMine = true;
        }

        //For every panel which is not a mine, 
        // including the unavailable ones from earlier,
        // determine and save the adjacent mines.
        foreach (var openPanel in Panels.Where(panel => !panel.IsMine))
        {
            var nearbyPanels = GetNeighbors(openPanel.X, openPanel.Y);
            openPanel.AdjacentMines = nearbyPanels.Count(z => z.IsMine);
        }

        //Mark the game as started.
        Status = GameStatus.InProgress;
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
    There's one last thing we need to finish the first move implementation: 
    a method which activates when a user makes a move, and if it is the first move, 
    calls our FirstMove() method. Here's that method:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other Properties and Methods
    
    public void MakeMove(int x, int y)
    {
        if (Status == GameStatus.AwaitingFirstMove)
        {
            FirstMove(x, y);
        }
        RevealPanel(x, y);
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
    All right! First move implementation is complete, and we can now move on to what happens on every other panel.
</p>

<h3>Revealing Panels</h3>

<p>
    For every move except the first one, clicking on a panel reveals that panel. 
    A more specific algorithm for moves after the first one might be this:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        When the user left-clicks on a panel, reveal that panel.
    </li>
    <li>
        If that panel is a mine, show all mines and end the game.
    </li>
    <li>
        If that panel is a zero, show that panel and all neighbors. 
        If any neighbors are also zero, show all their neighbors, 
        and continue until all adjacent zeroes and their neighbors are revealed. 
        (I termed this a "cascade reveal").
    </li>
    <li>
        If that panel is NOT a mine, check to see if any remaining unrevealed 
        panels are not mines. If there are any, the game continues.
    </li>
    <li>
        If all remaining unrevealed panels are mines, the game is complete. This is the "win" condition.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Using that algorithm, we end up with this method:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other Properties and Methods
    
    public void RevealPanel(int x, int y)
    {
        //Step 1: Find and reveal the clicked panel
        var selectedPanel = Panels.First(panel => panel.X == x 
                                                  && panel.Y == y);
        selectedPanel.Reveal();

        //Step 2: If the panel is a mine, show all mines. Game over!
        if (selectedPanel.IsMine)
        {
            Status = GameStatus.Failed;
            RevealAllMines();
            return;
        }

        //Step 3: If the panel is a zero, cascade reveal neighbors.
        if (selectedPanel.AdjacentMines == 0)
        {
            RevealZeros(x, y);
        }

        //Step 4: If this move caused the game to be complete, mark it as such
        CompletionCheck();
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
    We now have several methods to create to finish this part of our implementation.
</p>

<h4>Revealing All Mines</h4>

<p>
    The simplest of the new methods we need is this one: showing all mines on the board.
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other Methods and Properties

    private void RevealAllMines()
    {
        Panels.Where(x => x.IsMine)
        	  .ToList()
              .ForEach(x => x.IsRevealed = true);
    }
}</code></pre>

<h4>Cascade Reveal Neighbors</h4>

<p>
    When a zero-value panel is revealed, the game needs to then reveal all of that panel's neighbors, 
    and if any of the neighbors are zero, reveal the neighbors of that panel as well. 
    This calls for a recursive method:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other Methods and Properties
    
    public void RevealZeros(int x, int y)
    {
        //Get all neighbor panels
        var neighborPanels = GetNeighbors(x, y)
                               .Where(panel => !panel.IsRevealed);
                               
        foreach (var neighbor in neighborPanels)
        {
            //For each neighbor panel, reveal that panel.
            neighbor.IsRevealed = true;
            
            //If the neighbor is also a 0, reveal all of its neighbors too.
            if (neighbor.AdjacentMines == 0)
            {
                RevealZeros(neighbor.X, neighbor.Y);
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<h4>Is The Game Complete?</h4>

<p>
    A game of Minesweeper is complete when all remaining unrevealed panels are mines. 
    We can use this method to check for that:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other Properties and Methods
    
    private void CompletionCheck()
    {
        var hiddenPanels = Panels.Where(x => !x.IsRevealed)
                                 .Select(x => x.ID);
                                 
        var minePanels = Panels.Where(x => x.IsMine)
                               .Select(x => x.ID);
                               
        if (!hiddenPanels.Except(minePanels).Any())
        {
            Status = GameStatus.Completed;
            Stopwatch.Stop();
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
    With this functionality in place, there's only one thing left to do: flagging.
</p>

<h3>Flagging a Panel</h3>

<p>
    "Flagging" a panel means marking it as the location of a mine. Doing this 
    means that left-clicking that panel will do nothing.
</p>

<img src="../images/minesweeper/minesweeper-flags.png" />

<p>I mean, that is ONE way to get all the mines...</p>

<p>
    In our game, we will use right-click to flag a panel. Recall that our 
    Panel class already has a Flag() method. Now we just need to call 
    that method from the GameBoard class:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other Properties and Methods
    
    public void FlagPanel(int x, int y)
    {
        if (MinesRemaining > 0)
        {
            var panel = Panels.Where(z => z.X == x && z.Y == y).First();

            panel.Flag();
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
    There's only a little bit of the C# implementation left to do.
</p>

<h3>Implementing a Timer</h3>

<p>
    Take a look at the top part of the Minesweeper game we saw earlier:
</p>

<img src="../images/minesweeper/minesweeper-example.png" />

<p>
    Other than the smiley face's piercing stare, what do you notice? The counters!
</p>

<p>
    The left counter is for mines; it goes down as the number of flagged 
    panels increases. The right counter is for the time; it ticks up every second. 
    We need to implement a timer for our Minesweeper game.
</p>

<p>
    For this, we will use the C# 
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.stopwatch?view=netcore-3.1">Stopwatch class</a>. 
    We will use the following algorithm:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Whenever the game is created or reset, we reset the timer.</li>
    <li>When the player makes their first move, start the timer.</li>
    <li>When the game is either complete or failed, stop the timer.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The changes we need to make to our GameBoard class look like this:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">public class GameBoard
{
    //...Other Properties
    public Stopwatch Stopwatch { get; set; }
    
    //...Other Methods
    
    public void Reset()
    {
        Initialize(Width, Height, MineCount);
        Stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
    }
    
    public void FirstMove()
    {
        //...Implementation
        Stopwatch.Start();
    }
    
    private void CompletionCheck()
    {
        var hiddenPanels = Panels.Where(x => !x.IsRevealed)
                                 .Select(x => x.ID);
                                 
        var minePanels = Panels.Where(x => x.IsMine)
                               .Select(x => x.ID);
                               
        if (!hiddenPanels.Except(minePanels).Any())
        {
            Status = GameStatus.Completed;
            Stopwatch.Stop(); //New line
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
    Ta-da! With the timer implemented, all of our C# implementation for this Minesweeper game is 
    complete! But we're not done yet, oh no: we still need to write up the Blazor component and wire
    everything up.
</p>

<h3>Creating the Blazor Component</h3>

<p>
    In Blazor, we do not have "pages"; rather we use Components (files that have the .razor suffix). 
    To be fair, they look almost exactly like <a href="https://exceptionnotfound.net/tag/razorpages/">Razor Pages</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Here's a starting Blazor Component (.razor file) we can use for this post:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">@@page "/minesweeper"
@@using BlazorGames.Models.Minesweeper
@@using BlazorGames.Models.Minesweeper.Enums

@@code {
    GameBoard board = new GameBoard();
}</code></pre>

<p>
    As a reminder, the @@page directive sets the URI for the current component.
</p>

<p>
    Let's take a look at a Minesweeper board again:
</p>

<img src="../images/minesweeper/minesweeper-almost-done.png" />

<p>
    See the border running around the game area and the header? We need to have 
    a way to create that border. Since it is essentially an additional space on 
    any given side of the board, we need extra space in our calculations. Keep that in mind.
</p>

<p>
    For now, let's concentrate on the area of the board where the numbers and mines are. 
    For the size of the board X by Y, we need X + 2  columns of Y + 2 height, where 
    the extremes (uppermost, lowermost, leftmost, rightmost) rows and columns are the border. 
    Therefore our markup might look like this:
</p>

<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">&lt;div class="minesweeper-board"&gt;
    @@{
        var maxWidth = board.Width + 1;
        var maxHeight = board.Height + 1;
    }

    @@for (int i = 0; i &lt;= maxWidth; i++)
    {
        @@for (int j = 0; j &lt;= maxHeight; j++)
        {
            int x = i;
            int y = j;

            if (x == 0 && y == 0) //Upper-left corner
            {
                &lt;div class="minesweeper-border-jointleft"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            }
            else if (x == 0 && y == maxHeight) //Upper-right corner
            {
                &lt;div class="minesweeper-border-jointright"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            }
            else if (x == maxWidth && y == 0) //Lower-left corner
            {
                &lt;div class="minesweeper-border-bottomleft"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            }
            else if (x == maxWidth && y == maxHeight) //Lower-right corner
            {
                &lt;div class="minesweeper-border-bottomright"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            }
            else if (y == 0 || y == maxHeight) //Leftmost column
            {
                &lt;div class="minesweeper-border-vertical"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            }
            else if (x == 0 || x == maxWidth) //Rightmost column
            {
                &lt;div class="minesweeper-border-horizontal"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            }
            else if (y &gt; 0 && y &lt; maxHeight)
            {
                &lt;!-- Output panels --&gt;
            }
        }
    }
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p class="font-italic">
    NOTE: The CSS classes in use here are originally from 
    <a href="http://minesweeperonline.com/">Minesweeper Online</a>, were 
    modified and renamed by me for use in this project, and 
    <a href="https://github.com/exceptionnotfound/BlazorGames/blob/master/BlazorGames/wwwroot/css/games.css">can be viewed on GitHub</a>.
</p>

<p>
    We now need to consider how to output the panels themselves.
</p>

<h3>Displaying the Panels</h3>

<p>
    In our implementation a Panel may, at any time, be in one of five potential states:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Revealed Mine</li>
    <li>Revealed Number</li>
    <li>Revealed Blank</li>
    <li>Flagged</li>
    <li>Unrevealed</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We need special CSS classes for each state, and so the finished markup 
    for the page will need to include the following:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">&lt;div class="minesweeper-board"&gt;
@@{
    var maxWidth = board.Width + 1;
    var maxHeight = board.Height + 1;
}

@@for (int i = 0; i &lt;= maxWidth; i++)
{
    @@for (int j = 0; j &lt;= maxHeight; j++)
    {
        int x = i;
        int y = j;

        if (x == 0 && y == 0) //Upper-left corner
        {
            &lt;div class="minesweeper-border-jointleft"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        }

        //...All the other IF clauses

        else if (y &gt; 0 && y &lt; maxHeight)
        {
            var currentPanel = board.Panels.First(m =&gt; m.X == x
                                                          && m.Y == y);
            if (currentPanel.IsRevealed)
            {
                if (currentPanel.IsMine) //Mine
                {
                    &lt;div class="minesweeper-gamepiece minesweeper-mine"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                }
                else if (currentPanel.AdjacentMines == 0) //Blank
                {
                    &lt;div class="minesweeper-gamepiece minesweeper-0"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
                }
                else //Number
                {
                    &lt;div class="minesweeper-gamepiece minesweeper-@@currentPanel.AdjacentMines"&gt;@@currentPanel.AdjacentMines&lt;/div&gt;
                }
            }
            else if (currentPanel.IsFlagged)
            {
                &lt;div class="minesweeper-gamepiece minesweeper-flagged"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            }
            else //Unrevealed
            {
                &lt;div class="minesweeper-gamepiece minesweeper-unrevealed"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
            }
        }
    }
}
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
    There's an additional wrinkle to consider: in some of these states, namely the
    Flagged and Unrevealed ones, the user can interact with the panel by left clicking (to reveal) 
    or right-clicking (to flag). We need to implement that functionality.
</p>

<h4>Left-Click to Reveal</h4>

<p>
    You may recall that we implemented a MakeMove() method in the C# implementation. The reason why 
    was so that it could be called here. This is the markup for the unrevealed panel, 
    now with an @@onclick event:
</p>

<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">&lt;div class="minesweeper-gamepiece minesweeper-unrevealed"
     @@onclick="@@(() => board.MakeMove(x, y))"
     @@oncontextmenu="@@(() => board.FlagPanel(x, y))"
     @@oncontextmenu:preventDefault>
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
    There's a lot to dissect here:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The @@onclick directive is a Blazor directive that binds a C# method to an onclick event. 
        In this case, we are calling MakeMove() and passing the coordinates of the clicked panel.
    </li>
    <li>
        The @@oncontextmenu directive allows us to specify what should happen when the context menu 
        (AKA the right-click menu) should be displayed. Since we want to flag panels on right-click, 
        we say that here.
    </li>
    <li>
        The @@oncontextmenu:preventDefault is a specialized instruction to Blazor that prevents 
        the context menu from displaying on right-clicks.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Let's also see the markup for the flagged panel:
</p>

<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">&lt;div class="minesweeper-gamepiece minesweeper-flagged"
     @@oncontextmenu="@@(() => board.FlagPanel(x, y))"
     @@oncontextmenu:preventDefault>
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
    Okay! We have our playing area ready. Now let's build the header where the mine counter, timer, and face are placed.
</p>

<h3>The Header</h3>

<p>
    Here's the full markup for the header area:
</p>

<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">&lt;div class="minesweeper-board"
     @@oncontextmenu:preventDefault
     onmousedown="faceOooh(event);" &lt;!-- Explanation below --&gt;

     id="seconds_ones"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="minesweeper-border-vertical-long"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>Make 'Em Say "Oooh"</h3>

<p>
    There are certain things that Blazor, in its current form, is just not good at. 
    For example, in the desktop version of Minesweeper, whenever the user left-clicks 
    a panel the smiley face turns to an "oooh" face. Blazor cannot do this (or, more 
    accurately, I could not figure out how to do this in Blazor). So, I turned to 
    good old JavaScript to get the face to say "oooh!".
</p>

<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">function faceOooh(event) {
    if (event.button === 0) { //Left-click only
        document.getElementById("face").className = "minesweeper-face-oooh";
    }
}

function faceSmile() {
    var face = document.getElementById("face");
    
    if (face !== undefined)
        face.className = "minesweeper-face-smile";
}</code></pre>

<h3>What Time Is It Anyway?</h3>

<p>
    Surprisingly, to me anyway, the timer proved to be the most difficult part of 
    this entire implementation, and exactly why that is true requires some explaining.
</p>

<p>
    Blazor has a special method, ```StateHasChanged()```, which allows us developers 
    to notify Blazor that the state of its object has changed and it should re-render 
    the display. But my timer, you might remember, was implemented on the backend 
    as a C# Stopwatch class, and of course the C# code has no way to notify the Blazor 
    frontend that something has changed (namely, that a second has gone by).
</p>

<p>
    So, I had to fake it, and that required a couple parts. First I needed a JavaScript 
    method to display a passed-in time:
</p>

<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript">function setTime(hundreds, tens, ones) {
    var hundredsElement = document.getElementById("seconds_hundreds");
    var tensElement = document.getElementById("seconds_tens");
    var onesElement = document.getElementById("seconds_ones");

    if (hundredsElement !== null) {
        hundredsElement.className = "minesweeper-time-" + hundreds;
    }
    if (tensElement !== null) {
        tensElement.className = "minesweeper-time-" + tens;
    }
    if (onesElement !== null) {
        onesElement.className = "minesweeper-time-" + ones;
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
    On the Blazor component itself, I needed to use the special method 
    OnAfterRenderAsync, which fires after the control is rendered to the browser:
</p>

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="language-csharp">@@inject IJSRuntime _jsRuntime
@@inject NavigationManager _navManager

@@code {
    protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)
    {
        while (board.Status == GameStatus.InProgress && _navManager.Uri.Contains("minesweeper"))
        {
            await Task.Delay(500);
            var elapsedTime = (int)board.Stopwatch.Elapsed.TotalSeconds;
            var hundreds = GetPlace(elapsedTime, 100);
            var tens = GetPlace(elapsedTime, 10);
            var ones = GetPlace(elapsedTime, 1);

            await _jsRuntime.InvokeAsync&lt;string&gt;("setTime", hundreds, tens, ones);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
    This solution is 100% a hack; every half-second it invokes a JS method to display 
    the new time. To even be able to do this I had to inject two new dependencies to the component:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        IJSRuntime, which allows Blazor code to 
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/call-javascript-from-dotnet?view=aspnetcore-3.1">invoke JavaScript functions</a> AND
    </li>
    <li>
        NavigationManager, which allows <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/routing?view=aspnetcore-3.1">access to URIs used by a Blazor app</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Obviously this is not a perfect solution, but it works, which is <a href="https://exceptionnotfound.net/doing-it-right-vs-getting-it-done/"good enough for now</a>.
</p>

<h3>We're Done!</h3>
